## Short Bio

I am now a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am fortunated to be advised by [Prof. Sze Yiu Chau](https://szeyiuchau.github.io/).


Before coming to CUHK, I obtained my M.E. degree from Fudan University under supervisor [Prof. Zhe Zhou](https://www.y-droid.com/zhe/) and got my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Ocean University of China in June 2019.

My research interests include system security and Side-Channel attacks on computer hardwares. I am a new-comer to both fields, and feel free to contact me via email.  : )

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
